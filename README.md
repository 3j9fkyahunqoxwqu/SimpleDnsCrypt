# Simple DNSCrypt

Simple DNSCrypt is a simple management tool to configure dnscrypt-proxy on windows based systems.

If you are looking for an only command line tool, you can use the [dnscrypt-proxy](https://dnscrypt.org/) software. There are pre-compiled versions for any os.
The dnscrypt-proxy software is written and maintained by Frank Denis (@jedisct1).

### Status

**There will be bugs. May change. May break.**

Missing features:

- IPv6 support
- Secondary resolver support

### Installation

To install Simple DNSCrypt use the [latest MSI package](https://github.com/bitbeans/SimpleDnsCrypt/releases/download/0.2.3/SimpleDNSCrypt.msi).
You don`t need to download the dnscrypt-resolvers.csv or the dnscrypt-proxy package at all.
Both are included in the msi package, the dnscrypt-resolvers.csv can be updated from inside the software (and will be verified with minisign).

#### File Signing
The MSI package and the SimpleDnsCrypt.exe are signed via a *COMODO RSA Code Signing CA*. 
The files are signed under the name: *EAM Experience Area MÃ¼nsingen GmbH*

You also can verify the MSI package with [minisign](https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/).
The minisign [signature](https://github.com/bitbeans/SimpleDnsCrypt/releases/download/0.2.3/SimpleDNSCrypt.msi.minisig) can be verified with the following command:

	minisign -Vm SimpleDNSCrypt.msi -P RWTSM+4BNNvkZPNkHgE88ETlhWa+0HDzU5CN8TvbyvmhVUcr6aQXfssV

#### Uninstall
To uninstall Simple DNSCrypt and dnscrypt-proxy, just go to the windows Control Panel (Programs and Features) and search for Simple DNSCrypt.
