# Simple DNSCrypt

Simple DNSCrypt is a simple management tool to configure dnscrypt-proxy on windows based systems.

If you are looking for an only command line tool, you can use the [dnscrypt-proxy](https://dnscrypt.org/) software. There are pre-compiled versions for any os.
The dnscrypt-proxy software is written and maintained by Frank Denis (@jedisct1).

### Status

Missing features:

- Secondary resolver support (soon available)
- IPv6 support

### Installation

To install Simple DNSCrypt use the [latest MSI package](https://github.com/bitbeans/SimpleDnsCrypt/releases/download/0.2.6/SimpleDNSCrypt.msi).
You don`t need to download the dnscrypt-resolvers.csv or the dnscrypt-proxy package at all.
Both are included in the msi package, the dnscrypt-resolvers.csv can be updated from inside the software (and will be verified with minisign).

#### File Signing
The MSI package and the SimpleDnsCrypt.exe are signed via a *COMODO RSA Code Signing CA*. 
The files are signed under the name: *EAM Experience Area MÃ¼nsingen GmbH*

You also can verify the MSI package with [minisign](https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/).
The minisign [signature](https://github.com/bitbeans/SimpleDnsCrypt/releases/download/0.2.6/SimpleDNSCrypt.msi.minisig) can be verified with the following command:

	minisign -Vm SimpleDNSCrypt.msi -P RWTSM+4BNNvkZPNkHgE88ETlhWa+0HDzU5CN8TvbyvmhVUcr6aQXfssV

#### Uninstall
To uninstall Simple DNSCrypt and dnscrypt-proxy, just go to the windows Control Panel (Programs and Features) and search for Simple DNSCrypt.

#### Updates
Simple DNSCrypt will automatically check for new versions on startup.

##### Plugins

![plugin view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitbeans/SimpleDnsCrypt/master/img/plugins.png)

Simple DNSCrypt currently supports two plugins:

**libdcplugin_ldns_aaaa_blocking**

If your network doesn't support IPv6, chances are that your applications are still constantly trying to resolve IPv6 addresses, causing unnecessary slowdowns.

This plugin causes the proxy to immediately reply to IPv6 requests, without having to send a useless request to upstream resolvers, and having to wait for a response.

**libdcplugin_logging**

This plugin logs the DNS queries received by the proxy. The logs are stored in a local file.
You can choose the folder, where dnscrypt-proxy will store the logfile (dns.log).
